# React SPA

[This](https://post-todo-user-lists.vercel.app) is my tutorial project on React.    
While working on this project, I learned **React 18** and few libraries, such as:    
* React Readux
* Redux Toolkit
* React Router dom
* React Hook form
* Axios    

The main task was to work with [fake api - Jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), the correct use of dynamic routes and nested routes,
use one of the state managers - I chose the Redux Toolkit, work with the form at a more advanced level, work with axios (get, post, patch requests).
